# Travel Recommendation System

This repository contains the final project for the IBM JavaScript Essentials Certification Course on Coursera. The project is a web-based application that provides travel recommendations based on user input, showcasing fundamental JavaScript concepts including DOM manipulation, JSON data handling, and event-driven programming.

## Live Demo

Experience the live application here: [https://gxaditya.github.io/IBM-Javascript-Essentials-Final-Project/](https://gxaditya.github.io/IBM-Javascript-Essentials-Final-Project/)

## Features

- Dynamic Recommendations: Users can search for travel destinations like "beach", "temple", or "country" to get specific suggestions.
- Interactive UI: Features a clean, responsive layout for easy navigation and searching.
- Data Integration: Recommendations are fetched and filtered from a JSON data source.
- Search Management: Includes functionality to clear search results and reset the interface.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5: For the structure and layout of the web page.
- CSS3: For custom styling and ensuring a responsive user experience.
- JavaScript (ES6+): For handling logic, filtering data, and updating the DOM.
- JSON: Used as a lightweight data store for destination information.
